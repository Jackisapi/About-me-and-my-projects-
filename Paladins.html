    <h1>A little about me.</h1> 
    <h2>My top 5 paladins mains</h2>
<!--ordered list -->
<ol> 
<li>Androxis is my number 1 because he is easy to learn and probaley one of the most powerful</li>
<li> My second favorite is Bomb king because although he is dificult to learn he is a really fun carecter.</li>
<li> Third is victor because he is fun to play as and you feel powerful when your the only charecter that can run</li>
  <li> Forth is strix because he is good at sniping so i like to use him at a distcnce and then i hardley get harmed</li>
<li> Last place goes to lex but im not saying he is the worst because he was the first charecter i played as in paladins.</li> 
    </ol>
